 This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as "{}hot reloading"{}, but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.

This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If youâ€™re working on one, here is a \href{https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604\#issuecomment-528663101}{\texttt{ rough guide}} for Fast Refresh integration using this package.
